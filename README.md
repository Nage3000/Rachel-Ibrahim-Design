Rachel wanted to design a portfolio website for her graphic design and UI/UX design skills. This initial update to the framework we're using is to layout out the first few resources and pieces of critical information for the project.

We have organized the overall layout of the website, gotten together most of the resources, and are now simply looking to finalize the copy on the site. I hope the copy is completed by the end of the week and the site should be for the most part complete. Today we added a nice carousel effect of logos for previous companies Rachel has worked with. We also linked and activated the contact form to receieve messages and be sent directly to Rachel's email via FormSpree.
